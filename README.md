# CycleNet
Official implementation of "Cycle Invariant Positional Encoding for Graph Representation Learning", which is accepted as oral presentation in the Leaning on Graphs Conference (LoG 2023).



We implement CycleNet on 4 backbones, Dist2Cycle, SignNet-BasisNet, CWN, and SAT. Move to each folder to reproduce our results.
